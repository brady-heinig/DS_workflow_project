Stat 386 Final Project

As part of my Data Science Process class at Brigham Young University, I was tasked with going end to end on a data science project in order to develop a blog and dashboard that could communicate my work. My research question centered around settling the debate about who is the greatest NBA player of all-time. I focused my efforts on Michael Jordan and LeBron James, as they are the two players who receive the most recognition in this conversation. 

Included in this repository is my notebook where I scraped and cleaned the data (final_project.ipynb), a notebook where I built all of my visualizations (vizualizations.ipynb), my dataset (goat.csv), and a folder of all feedback I recieved and changes that I made.

Enjoy!
